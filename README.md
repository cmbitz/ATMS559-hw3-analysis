# ATMS559 Analysis Code for HW3

## Get on the NCAR Jupyter Hub. I recommend using Chrome for your browser.

[jupyterhub.hpc.ucar.edu/stable/hub/home](https://jupyterhub.hpc.ucar.edu/stable/hub/home) 

## Installation

You will need to install the code from a Terminal on NCAR's system,
either Casper or Derecho. To get to a Terminal, go to the + tab at the
top of this section on Jupyter Hub desktop, then find the Terminal
icon and click it.

I recommend putting this code either in your home or work space on
NCAR's computes. For example, if you want to use your work directory
(like I do below) first go to that directory using the cd command from
the Terminal and then issue the git clone command as follows:

```
cd /glade/work/$USER
git clone https://github.com/cmbitz/ATMS559-hw3-analysis.git
```

## Start the notebooks in the LatLonMaps, EnergyTransport, ZonalMeans, and  OceanAnalysis
Navigate to the directory where you just put the code with the directory tree on the left.
Then choose one of the four directories, Click on the notebook and check it out.
Note the KernelFB directoy is not ready for prime time. I'll let you know when it is.

If you need to choose a python environment, NPL 2024a worked for me
